## Project Overview

### Introduction:
This is an analysis on Births in the US by year, state, and education level of the mother: 2016-2021. This project aims to analyze the trends and patterns of births in the United States from 2016 to 2021, focusing on the demographic variables of the mother's education level, age, geographical location (state), birth rates, and temporal changes over the specified period. By exploring these dimensions, the project seeks to provide insights into potential correlations, disparities, and implications for public health policies and interventions.
